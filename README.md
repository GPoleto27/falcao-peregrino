# falcao-peregrino
Embedded system for Falcão Peregrino, a steel rope robot for Desafio de Robótica CEEP

## Pin-out
| Pin | Mode | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Input Pull-up | Interruption switch to reverse motor direction |
| 3 | Input Pull-up | Interruption switch to stop motor |
| 4 | Input | Switch to start motor |
| 9 | Output | Brushless Motor PWM |

## Working Principle
This system is attached to a steel rope, driven by a brushless motor.
The motor is controlled by a PWM signal, which is generated by the Arduino board.
The motor is powered by a 12V battery, and the system is powered by a BEC (Battery Eliminator Circuit) that converts the 12V to 5V. The system has three switches: one to start the motor, one to stop the motor, and one to reverse the motor direction. When the motor is started, the system will move through the rope until the reverse switch is pressed. The system will then move in the opposite direction until the stop switch is pressed. The system will stop and wait to be restarted.
